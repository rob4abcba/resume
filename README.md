## Projects
### [Restaurant Reviews App]
- Developed a Progresssive Web Application (PWA) as part of my Mobile Web Specialist (MWS) Nanodegree that I earned after receiving a scholarship from Udacity and Google as part of their competitive "Grow With Google" competition/scholarship.
- Stage1: Used MapBox API to display a map of restaurants from different categories/neighborhoods. Converted the site to a responsive design. Implemented accessibility features in the site HTML. Added a ServiceWorker script to cache requests to all of the siteâ€™s assets (so that any page visited by a user will be accessible when the user is offline).
- Stage2: Upgraded the web app to work with server data instead of local memory. Used IndexedDB to cache JSON responses to maintain offline operability with the development server. Updated the service worker to store the JSON received by requests using the IndexedDB API.  Met the minimum performance requirements.  
- Stage3: Added a form to allow users to create their own reviews. Add functionality to defer updates until the user is connected.
